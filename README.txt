5525 Final Project

- Objective: Train traditional classification ML models on image data to classify chess pieces.

- Data: Chess pieces pictures from multiple sources on Kaggle:
 1. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brendan45774/chess-piece-dectection
 2. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imtkaggleteam/chess-pieces-detection-image-dataset
 3. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/krithiik/chess-pieces/code
 4. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/niteshfre/chessman-image-dataset/code

- Approach: Preprocess the image data, apply Decision Tree and SVM to classify, benchmark performance by comparing with classifying image data by Neural Networks
